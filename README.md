# Repository Description
This repository contains a collection of scripts developed by Team Microstructure2025-M of the CONNeXIN training program to support a longitudinal neuroimaging research study on Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia. The scripts are organized to provide an end-to-end workflow that ensures reproducibility, consistency, and efficiency in handling neuroimaging data across different stages of the study. 

# Scripts Description
-**Data Structure Organization**[data_structure_and_validation.sh]: Automates the organization of raw neuroimaging data into a standardized, BIDS-compliant format for streamlined downstream analysis.
-**Quality Control[Mriqc.sh]**: Assesses data integrity and detect motion artifacts, missing files, or anomalies in diffusion-weighted and structural (T1w) imaging data.
-**Preprocessing [Preprocessing.sh]**: Implements preprocessing steps (e.g., eddy-current correction, brain extraction,denoising, gibbs ring removal and gradient compatibility checks) necessary to prepare diffusion MRI data for TBSS analysis.
- **Analysis**: Executes TBSS analysis to assess changes in white matter microstructural integrity in subjects with Alzheimer’s dementia.
